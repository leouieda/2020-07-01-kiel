# Geophysical research powered by open-source

Invited talk at Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel, Germany.

See the slides at https://www.leouieda.com/2020-07-01-kiel

This is a talk I've been working on and tweaking over a few months now. It's
about my path through geophysics and open-source software, how it's shaped my
research and teaching, what I see as the future of this area (with some tips
for informing yourself on current software best practices), and some of the
research we're doing at the
[Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab](https://www.compgeolab.org/).
